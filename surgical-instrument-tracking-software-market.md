<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Instrument Tracking Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>RFID</li><li>Barcode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surgical instrument tracking software enhances inventory management in healthcare through two primary types: RFID and barcode systems. RFID uses radio frequency identification tags that allow real-time tracking of instruments without direct line-of-sight, improving efficiency and reducing losses. Conversely, barcode systems require manual scanning of instruments, providing a more cost-effective solution but with limited automation. Both systems ensure accurate tracking, enhance sterilization processes, and ultimately contribute to improved patient safety and operational efficiency in surgical environments.</p></p>
